# Portfolio Project Overview

This README provides insights into my web development journey, focusing on the process, challenges encountered, and the learning experience gained while creating my web portfolio.

## Process

My development process primarily revolved around understanding the interaction between HTML and the CSS libraries I utilized, namely Bootstrap and Materialize. This understanding enabled me to streamline my coding process, allowing me to input code more efficiently. Despite this preparation, I still encountered numerous instances of trial and error throughout the project. At times, I experimented with different versions of code to determine the most effective approach. Ultimately, this project reinforced the notion that experimentation is an integral aspect of the creative process. I appreciated the hands-on learning experience, particularly in exploring CSS frameworks and customization.

## Challenges and Solutions

While developing the web portfolio, I faced various challenges, including:

- Understanding the intricate interactions between HTML and CSS libraries.
- Experimenting with different versions of code to optimize the design.
- Balancing between following a detailed plan and allowing room for experimentation.

To overcome these challenges, I:

- Dedicated time to thoroughly comprehend the documentation and usage of Bootstrap and Materialize.
- Maintained a flexible approach, allowing for iterative improvements and adjustments based on trial and error.
- Embraced the creative process, recognizing that experimentation is essential for growth and innovation.

## Lessons Learned

Creating my web portfolio provided invaluable lessons, including:

- The importance of hands-on experience in learning CSS frameworks and customization.
- The inevitability of spending significant time experimenting and iterating, even with a detailed plan.
- The necessity of embracing trial and error as a natural part of the creative process.
